        The game is played on a 2D grid given to you at the start of the game. The grid is made up of walls and empty
        spaces. Each player controls a team of minions that can move along the grid.
      </p>
        <h3 style="font-size: 14px;
      font-weight: 700;
      padding-top: 5px;
      padding-bottom: 15px;">The Map</h3>
        <p>
        The grid is generated randomly, and can vary in <var>height</var> and <var>width</var>.
        Each cell of the map is either:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>A wall (represented by a pound character: <action>#</action>)</li>
          <li>An empty space (represented by a dot character: <action>.</action>)</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
        Maps are always symmetrical across the central vertical axis. Minions cannot go pass the border of the map or go
          through walls. They can only pass through empty cells. Empty cells may contain <b>coins</b>. Minions can collect coins
          as they move over cells that contain coins. Collecting coins increases the <var>score</var> of the player.
        </p>

<!--MINIONS-->

      font-weight: 700;
      padding-top: 5px;
      padding-bottom: 15px;">The Minions</h3>
        <p>
          Each player starts with the same number of minions, up to <action>5</action> each.
        </p>
        <p>
          Your minions <b>cannot see through walls</b>. On each turn you have vision on all of the enemy minions and coins
          that can be connected by a continuous straight line to any one of your minions.
        </p>
        <p>
          At each turn, you are given information regarding your own alive minions, the opponent's visible minions and all the
          visible coins. For each minion, you are given its identifier, its coordinates and its health. For each coins,
          you are given its coordinates.
        </p>
        Minions can receive the following commands (a minion can only receive one command per turn):
        <ul>
          <li>
            <action>MOVE</action>: Give the minion a target position. The minion will find a shortest route to that position
            and <b>make the first move along the way</b>. The minion will not take into account the presence of other minions when choosing a route.
          </li>
          <li>
            <action>WAIT</action>: Do nothing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Minions can also receive special commands which enables it to perform a powerup which can deal damage to the opponent
          minions. Refer to the the <b>power up</b> section.
        </p>

        <p>
          See the Game Protocol section for more information on sending commands to your minion. Note that, minions
          <b>never</b> collide and multiple minions can exist in the same cell.
        </p>

      padding-top: 5px;
      padding-bottom: 15px;">Flag and Flag Base</h3>
        <p>Each player's flag resides at the flag-base in the beginning of the game. A player's minions can only carry
          opponent's flag. Note that each player's minions <b>cannot</b> carry their own flag. A flag can be carried by
          only one minion at a time. <b>Once a minion obtains a flag, it cannot let it go until it is dead.</b> Following
          the flag-carrying-minion's death, <b>the flag remains at that cell where the minion died until some other minion
            picks it up</b>.
        </p>

        <p>
          There are 3 types of power ups that a minion can use.
          <ul>
          <li>
            <action>FIRE</action>: A minion that uses fire will ignite every cell in its vision with fire. That is, the whole
            row and the whole column up until the nearest wall will be ignited. Any opponent minion caught in this fire
            will take damage.
          </li>
          <li>
            <action>FREEZE</action>: A minion that uses freeze will freeze every cell in its vision with ice. That is,
            the whole row and the whole column up until the nearest wall will be frozen. Any opponent minion caught in
            this ice will be frozen (stuck) in its position for <var>timeout</var> amount of time.
          </li>
          <li>
            <action>MINE</action>: A minion that uses mine can plant a bomb at a certain cell of the grid. Any opponent
            minion that walks over that cell will trigger the bomb to explode. Once a bomb explodes, the opponent minion
            takes damage.
          </li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
          Each power up requires a certain <var>score</var>. Refer to <b>protocol</b> section on how to use power up command.
        </p>

      padding-bottom: 15px;">Game end</h3>
        <p>Game can end on any of the following 3 conditions:
          <ul>
            <li>
              One of the player's minions captures opponent's flag and returns to its own flag-base.
            </li>
            <li>
              All the minions of a player are killed.
            </li>
            <li>
              The game doesn't end on any of the two conditions above for more than 200 rounds. In that case, the
              player with the highest score wins and the game is forcefully ended.
